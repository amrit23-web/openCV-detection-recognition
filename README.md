# Real-Time Face Attendance using OpenCV and Firebase
This project is a real-time face attendance system implemented using OpenCV, face recognition, cvzone, and Firebase integration. The system captures video from a webcam, detects faces in real-time, and recognizes known faces by comparing their face encodings. The attendance data is stored and updated in a Firebase Realtime Database, and student images are stored in Firebase Storage.

# Features
Real-time face detection and recognition using OpenCV and the face_recognition library.
Overlaying webcam feed on a graphical background.
Displaying student information and images for recognized faces.
Updating attendance data in the Firebase Realtime Database.
Integrating with Firebase Storage to retrieve student images.
